[teach01:256033] Rank 0 is not bound (or bound to all available processors)
This program has two graph generators: generate_nice_graph and generate_sneaky_graph. If you intend to submit, your code will be timed on the sneaky graph, remember to try both.
Running with 1 MPI process(es) and OpenMP threads.
Generate a graph for testing purposes (i.e.: a nice and conveniently designed graph :) )
0.00 seconds to generate the graph.
9640 iterations achieved in 10.00 seconds (MPI+OpenMP optimized)
